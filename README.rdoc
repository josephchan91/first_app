I added a scope to my song model (song.rb) for getting all songs that do not
belong to any playlist. Next, in my songs controller index method, I assigned
these songs to a @songs_no_playlist instance variable. Finally, in songs#index, 
I added a table for these songs under 'SONGS WITHOUT PLAYLIST'.
